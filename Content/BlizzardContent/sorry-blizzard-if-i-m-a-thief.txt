We might be violating "no disassemble" rule, but the models are intact and animations only went conversions from FBX to UE4 coordinates. At http://us.blizzard.com/en-sg/company/about/legal-faq.html we've read that it is allowed to make total conversion of your games. If it's a misunderstanding, we are more than eager to solve this issue on your terms, whether it'd be deleting all of your assets or anything else. Sorry for the inconvenience, if we caused one. Anyways, thanks for the oportunity to learn. It's great to work with these marvelous murlocs! Rwlrwlrwlrwl!
